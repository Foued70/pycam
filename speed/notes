This folder is for making a few performance comparisons in C and Python.



OSX isn't behaving quite right for me, I needed to add some of this to my ~.bash_profile

OPENCV_ROOT=/usr/local/
export OPENCV_ROOT

locate opencv.pc

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig/
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

g++ -Wall `pkg-config --cflags opencv` `pkg-config --libs opencv` -o diff diff.c
