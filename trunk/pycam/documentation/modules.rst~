Pycam's Modules
===============

**Camera**
This is a Pygame camera that uses OpenCV. This was usefull back when the Pygame Camera didn't work
on every platform or with many cameras. Now it is unneeded as pygame camera includes an opencv option.


**VideoCapturePlayer**
A VideoCapturePlayer object is an encapsulation of 
    the display of a video stream. 
    
    A process can be given (as a function) that is run
    on every frame between capture and display.
    
    For example a filter function that takes and returns a 
    surface can be given. This player will take the webcam image, 
    pass it through the filter then display the result.
    
    If the function takes significant computation time (>1second)
    The VideoCapturePlayer takes 3 images between each, this flushes
    the buffer, ensuring an updated picture is used in the next computation.
     
    If a new version of pygame is installed - this class uses the pygame.camera module, otherwise 
    it uses opencv.
