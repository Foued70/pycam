Computer Vision - C versus Python's documentation!
=============================================================

Python is a popular language widely adopted by
the scientific community due to its clear syntax and an extensive  
number of specialized packages. For image processing or computer vision 
development, two libraries are prominently used:
NumPy/SciPy and OpenCV with a Python wrapper. In this project,
we present a comparative evaluation of both libraries, assessing
their performance and their usability. We also describe our
results regarding the performance of OpenCV accessed through
a python wrapper versus the native C implementation.
