C/C++
=====
We were also interested to learn how the performance of **OpenCV** compares
natively with its wrapper. To this end the following C++ examples were created:

* Webcam snapshot
* VideoCapturePlayer
* Gaussian Blur
* Background Subtract
* Median Filter


.. note::
    All the examples use the VideoCapturePlayer for timing and display.

To build the examples run:

>>> ./buildall.sh
