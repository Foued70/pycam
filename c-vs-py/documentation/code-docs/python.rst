Python
=========================
We were also interested to learn how the performance of **OpenCV** compares
natively with its wrapper. To this end the following Python examples were created:
 .. note::
    There are some examples in SciPy and some in OpenCV and some in both.
    
    
* Webcam snapshot
* VideoCapturePlayer
* Gaussian Blur
* Background Subtract
* Median Filter
* Harris Feature Detect



.. note::
    All the examples use the VideoCapturePlayer for timing and display.
  
    

To run the examples run:

>>> python example_name

These examples rely on OpenCV and SciPy for many things. 
Check that VideoCapturePlayer works on its own first.
