The directory lib contains the modified cvEyeTracker library.
It requires OpenCV and Firewire to build.

libexample shows the sample debug application, this uses a system
copy of the cvEyeTrack library. It shows the scene image, the eye
image and the starburst algorithm output image.

boxy is an example application, currently it compiles its own
version of cvEyeTracker.

swiglib is an attempt on wrapping the library for Python.
